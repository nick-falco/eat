<h3 align="center">Evolution of Algebraic Terms</h3>

<p>
EAT is software implementation of the algorithms described in the paper Evolution of Algebraic Terms (EAT) 4: Biological Beam Algorithms. Given an arbitrary performance specification, the program systematically designs a digital ciruit using binary logic on groupoids of size 3 or larger. The program's success is documented by its ability to consistently find such designs from an incredibly vast search space in fractions of
a second. It has applications in both the fields of Mathematics and Computer Engineering.
